# EVENT         : Something that happens (e.g. inspection, application)
# STATE         : condition or circumstance of an ITEM (e.g. judgement outcome)
# OBSERVATION   : type of EVENT in which STATE is recorded (e.g. score, grade)
# PLAN          : Steps with resources and times to reach target state
# CASE          : container of EVENTs arising from SERVICE usage (e.g. care case)
# METHOD        : defined procedure to carry out task (e.g. data scrape, triage)
# OBJECTIVE     : desired outcome (e.g. improve housing, reduce risk)
# TARGET        : desired future STATE
